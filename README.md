## How the Game Works
The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

There is a star rating (from 1 to at least 3) that reflects the player's performance. It starts with 3 stars. After 24th move it gets down to 2 stars, and after 32nd move it goes to 1 stars.

You can restart the game anytime, which will reset the game progress.
